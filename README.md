# Alarm-clock
The project contains a Digital Alarm Clock where you can set as many alarms as you want. 
The first part of the project contains a digital clock which keeps on getting updated every second. 
In the second part we can set an alarm and all the new alarms being set will be added to a list below and will the played at the right time. 
With every new alarm being set a delete button will be given. On clicking that button you will be bale to disable to alarm and remove it from the webpage.
